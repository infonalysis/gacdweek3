### Study Design
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ

tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

### Data Cleaning Process
The data sets presented here are derived from the UCI HAR dataset.  Those data were modified as described below only by the accompanying run_analysis.R script.  Examination of that script is the best way to understand the process used to clean the original data.

1. Column names were extracted from features.txt
2. A set of action codes and description were extracted from activity_labels.txt
3. The testing data, including the following measurements, were loaded into a data table using the previously loaded column names
  - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
  - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
  - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
  - Its activity label. 
  - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
4. The subject IDs and activity codes for each measurements were loaded from seperate files and added as additional columns
5. The action codes were then replaced with descriptive labels using the previously loaded action code data
6. Steps 3, 4, and 5 were repeated with the training data to create a separate data table
7. The measurements of the means and standard deviations from the two data sets were then concatenated row wise into a single data set
8. This combined data set was written out as tidiedData1.csv 
9. A second data set was constructed reporting the mean of the values of each column of tidiedData1.csv.  This was written out as summarizedData1.csv
